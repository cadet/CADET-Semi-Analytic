* GNU autotools for management of build/installation. 

* Replaced GSL-style FunctionClass with FtnBase and Function classes.

* Implemented Clenshaw algorithm for GaussKronrod::chebyshev_series()
  and GaussKronrod::chebyshev_series_deriv()

* Pass references instead of pointers for methods in GaussKronrod and
  Workspace classes, e.g., GaussKronrod::qk(), Workspace::qag().

* Eliminated "limit" argument in Workspace::qag(); instead use value
  passed to constructor.


Notes for 0.900 release:

Initial release of quadpack++ provides only the most basic Workspace::qag()
routine for adaptive quadrature. The minimal set of parent classes of 
Workspace and supporting classes like FunctionClass are provided. 

A minimal set of test codes is included in the tests/ directory.
