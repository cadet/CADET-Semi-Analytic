The core routines are implemented in templated header files in the /include
path, requiring nothing to be built or linked against. 

HTML Documentation can be installed by running doxygen in the root directory
of the source tree. To produce other formats, edit the configuration in
Doxyfile. 

Autoconf and Automake definitions are provided for future expansion of the 
library. These can be also used to compile the test routines and install the 
header files. In the root directory of the source tree, run:

$ autoreconf 

and follow any further instructions. (Possibly one must run automake with
the --add-missing options.) Then follow the standard GNU installation
procedure:

$ ./configure 
$ make
$ make install

The --help option of the ./configure script gives hints for fine tuning
the build and installation process.
